Cause all that I can say is that it's obvious, it's obvious you're all I see, all I see

So you wanna believe all the things you've been told
And all the promises that you won't grow old
In the life made up of strings
Being pulled by secret beings
And now I know my falls and fights that brought me here
Of things that seem to disappear you can't understand my sane nightmare

In my bed of black roses

In my red sky hypnosis
It's only my beginning
And I have the feeling I'll go
Down my own road

Everyone still walks with fear in their lives
Past the place movie stars go to die
Streetlights filter through my blinds
Knowing life's a real short time
And now I shake the hands of all my old enemies
I ignore the threat of their disease
I choose the road ahead I please

In my bed of black roses
Where I dream secrets the back of my eyelids keep


In my red sky hypnosis
It's only my beginning
And I have the feeling I'll go

If this is what you are
Than this is where I am
If this is where you are
Than this is where I stand
I stand alone

Resurrected from the past

Getting closer to my door

But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

[Verse 1]
Did you really think I would falter my friend?
I've destroyed you before I'll destroy you again
I'm the hell that is your future
I'll incinerate your past
I'm the devil on your shoulder
But I'll always be your better half
We might share one body
But this spine is fucking mine
By now you should know
You're just a spectator, I'm the show
Is this the end of me?


[Chorus]
Cause I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murderer's brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

[Verse 2]
Did you really think you could Hyde from me, doctor?
Have you not seen the legacy I've carved into the flesh of this city?
Even Van Gogh would call it a bloody good impression
An artist of infection and you're just another piece in my collection
A mirror image of perfection
Who's time has fucking come

[Chorus]
And I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murderer's brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

[Bridge]
Friends and fellow countrymen, lend me your ears
The following revelation's for you skeptics to hear
There exists no good, only unrealized evil
I'll bring hope to the sinners
And death to the people


[Breakdown]
I tear apart the pages of the story of my life

[Chorus]
And I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murderer's brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

[Outro]
Because I can't stop seeing red
I'm seeing red
The doctor is dead
I bid thee farewell
Fuck my fate
Just save a seat for me in hell"
"""December"" - Neck Deep",slow,alternative rock,sad,2010s,"[Verse 1]
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December


[Verse 2]
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could have been
My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more

That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors

A whole side of you that went missing’s gone
And all I'd thought of you is wrong
Gotta step away for perspective
Need to take a chance to clear my head
Don't wanna understand your position
Oughta wash my hands of you and run

Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you
Held trapped by what we were

No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you

Spent time today reminiscing
Think I learned a lot about who we are
Couldn't diagnose your condition
But now I see the signs you left behind

Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you
And the truth remains unheard

No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you


Some roads you can't come back from when you extract truth from the lie

No, I'll never feel the same

Steady hands just take the wheel

But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could

Long enough to know that it was him

Hoping that I might forget her and the bad taste
That she left when she was leaving me

Out of this place

You changed yourself and I changed me

Then you screamed the bridge
And I cried the verse
And our chorus came out unrehearsed
And you smiled the whole way through it
I guess maybe that's what's worse

And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot


A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead"

BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said ""Let's make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool""
You know I'mma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it popping now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers

It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold

So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Put some music on while I pour
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside
C'mon baby
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - Oooh baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has ben - I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that old out
Ahh, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside
Brr it's cold....
It's cold out there
Can't you stay a while longer baby
Well... I really shouldn't .... alright
Make it worth your while baby

""Bah, humbug""
No, that's too strong
Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar pictures, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with


Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
Of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?


So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wandering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break, this year's been crazy""
I said ""Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending!

You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty, wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""


[Verse 5]
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked, jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce"

"""Hotel California"" - Eagles",medium,rock,happy,1970s,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""
[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

When boy meets girl

When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore

Just like a pasta e fazul, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love

But you know, you're not dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see

"""From Time"" -  Drake, Jhene Aiko",slow,hip-hop/rap,sad ,2010s,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood

Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my moms be smoking mad crack
My dad went out for a fast snack, and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it (uh-huh, uh-huh)
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?' It seems like my life's been cursed
Ever since I was a child, and how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown; I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
Aiiyyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how

I won't, that's how  Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream (word up)
Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday
And it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets, slate robbing suckers for funds (give it up, give it up)
Now everyday I creep with the heat
Ain't nothing sweet, I rob for meat
If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar
Then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living hell
Then I started to realize – I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiiyyo I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'  Doing time was full of stress G, all the
Fighting's and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease; I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic
Cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot (word up)

Damn real shit nigga no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy knock it off
I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off
Damn now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, ""What mean the world to me?""
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, ""Watch the snakes cause they watching you""
I told her, ""Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!""
She said, ""You bout to miss church"" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative
Nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting
Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking
Like, ""Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga""
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with"
"""Honestly"" - Pink Sweat$",slow,hip-hop/rap,sad ,2010s,"She said, ""Baby, I'm afraid to fall in love
'Cause what if it's not reciprocated?""
I told her, ""Don't rush girl, don't you rush
Guess it's all a game of patience""
She said, ""What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know""
I told her, ""Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go""
'Cause I want you
I want you
I want- I want you
'Cause I want you

Would you run away from me?""
I told her, ""Baby, we all got bags full of shit that we don't want
But I can't unpack it for you, baby""
She said, ""What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know""
I told her, ""Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go""

"""Lucky You"" - Eminem, Joyner",fast,hip-hop/rap,happy,2010s,"Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woah!
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I, run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno
Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto, and all of you culo
They debated the level, I've been to ghetto to ghetto
Looking for something I prolly could never find now
Shit get real up until the beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone, and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap, let's recap
Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (whoa)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spider move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We can not give a fuck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya, advance

Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly

Demigod, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy
Cornball taking shots at me

"""Regulate"" - Warren G, Nate Dogg",fast,hip-hop/rap,happy,1990s,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone
Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck""
Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said ""damn, what's next?""
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate
I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G
Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice, ""
""would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the east side motel
I'm tweaking
Onto a whole new level
G-Funk
Stept towards
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level
The rythmn is the base and the base is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rythmn is life
And life is rythmn
If you know like I know
You don't want to step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate"
